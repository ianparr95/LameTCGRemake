Pokemon TCG Engine, meant to be easily modifiable so that new cards and abilities can be easily added.
Things left to be implemented: Supporter Cards (as opposed to trainerCards), more pokepowers (only raindance so far is added) and more move effects etc.

Game runs through mainpackage/BattleGui.java, which runs DebugConsole which runs a basic game of pokemon TCG in a console.
