for pokemon:
evol = from where we evolve from. can have commas to seperate etc
Venusaur: for example:...
[evol]Ivysaur,Wartotle
[stage]2

[level] is to distinguish same pokemon but different cards AND SHOUD BE IMMEDIATELY AFTER NAME
type c = colorless, l = lightning, f = fire, g = grass, s = fighting, p = psychic
	 w = water

weak = weaknesses, can seperate with comma
[weak]f,g etc..

then for moves:
a move ends when we see a new [mname] or a new [name] for a new pokemon
or a [ENDFILE]

for mcoin, refers to how many coins we toss.
[mcoinheads]AGILITY,DAMAGE_SELF would mean:
we apply agility to ourself, but then damage our self.
then:
[mcoinheads_2]40
means since DAMAGE_SELF is second in order from AGILITY,
we apply 40 to the DAMAGE_SELF thing, which is the damage we deal to self.

[meffect]ALSO THE SAME
also DISCARD_ENERGY_SELF
then meffect_1 if is FC, means discard fire, then any type.
etc..

POKEMON POWERS ALWAYS BEFORE MOVES.
